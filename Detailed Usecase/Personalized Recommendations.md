## üìò **Introduction**

In today's competitive market, providing a personalized shopping experience can be the key to winning customer loyalty and boosting sales. Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool for creating customized promotions and personalized product recommendations, transforming the way businesses interact with their customers. By leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning algorithms, AI can enhance the shopping experience, drive customer satisfaction, and increase conversion rates.

## üåê **Implementation and Application**

### üîç Data Analysis

Generative AI systems begin by analyzing a wide array of customer data. This includes past purchase history, browsing behavior, demographic information, and customer feedback. By collecting and analyzing this comprehensive data, AI can develop a deep understanding of customer preferences and buying patterns.

**Example:** 
An online retailer can analyze a customer's previous purchases, the products they've viewed, their age, gender, and location. This data helps in identifying trends and predicting future buying behavior, which is crucial for making personalized recommendations.

### ü§ñ Recommendation Engine

Using sophisticated machine learning algorithms, AI generates personalized product recommendations tailored to each customer. These recommendations are based on the analyzed data and are designed to match the customer's preferences and increase the likelihood of purchase.

**Example:** 
If a customer frequently buys athletic wear, the AI can recommend the latest sports gear, running shoes, or fitness accessories, which are more likely to resonate with the customer's interests.

### üí° Promotional Offers

AI also plays a significant role in designing customized promotional offers. By identifying which types of promotions resonate best with individual customers, AI can increase engagement and conversion rates.

**Example:** 
AI can determine that a particular customer responds well to discount codes for bulk purchases. The system can then send personalized promotional emails offering a discount on their next bulk purchase, encouraging them to buy more.

### üîÑ Dynamic Adjustments

The recommendation engine continuously learns and adapts based on new customer interactions and feedback. This ensures that the recommendations remain relevant and effective over time, adapting to any changes in customer preferences.

**Example:** 
If a customer starts showing interest in a new category of products, such as switching from buying books to buying electronics, the AI will adjust its recommendations to reflect this new interest.



##  üì© Traditional Method: Collaborative Filtering using surprise library

```python
pip install scikit-surprise
```
### Here's a simple implementation of a recommendation system using collaborative filtering:

```python
import pandas as pd
from surprise import Dataset, Reader, SVD
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split
from surprise import accuracy

# Load dataset
data = {
    'user_id': ['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C'],
    'item_id': ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4', 'item1', 'item4'],
    'rating': [5, 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 4]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define a reader to read the data
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))
dataset = Dataset.load_from_df(df[['user_id', 'item_id', 'rating']], reader)

# Split the dataset into training and testing
trainset, testset = train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.25)

# Use the SVD algorithm for collaborative filtering
algo = SVD()

# Train the algorithm on the trainset
algo.fit(trainset)

# Predict ratings for the testset
predictions = algo.test(testset)

# Compute and print the accuracy
accuracy.rmse(predictions)

# Function to get recommendations for a specific user
def get_recommendations(user_id, num_recommendations=5):
    all_items = df['item_id'].unique()
    rated_items = df[df['user_id'] == user_id]['item_id']
    unrated_items = [item for item in all_items if item not in rated_items]

    predictions = [algo.predict(user_id, item) for item in unrated_items]
    predictions.sort(key=lambda x: x.est, reverse=True)

    top_recommendations = predictions[:num_recommendations]
    return [(rec.iid, rec.est) for rec in top_recommendations]

# Get recommendations for user 'A'
recommendations = get_recommendations('A')
print("Top recommendations for user 'A':", recommendations)

```
## Simplified Code Generation Using AI-Horizon's SDK

## Steps to Get Started with Our SDK

Installation

```python
# Unfortunately, our SDK is not publicly available and cannot be installed for free.
# Please contact us at neelesh[@]ai-horizon.io for more information on acquiring access to our SDK.
```

Configuration:

```python
import openai
import our_api

our_api.api_key = 'our_api_key'
```

Usage

```python
import requests

# AI Horizon API endpoint and API key (replace with your actual API endpoint and key)
api_endpoint = 'our_endpoint'
api_key = 'our_api_key'

def generate_recommendations(user_data, api_key):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    payload = {
        'user_data': user_data,
        'task': 'personalized_recommendations'
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example user data
user_data = {
    'user_id': 'A',
    'purchase_history': ['item1', 'item2'],
    'browsing_history': ['item3', 'item4'],
    'preferences': 'sports and fitness'
}

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = generate_recommendations(user_data, api_key)
if recommendations:
    print("Personalized Recommendations:")
    for rec in recommendations['recommendations']:
        print(f"- {rec}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve recommendations from AI Horizon API")

```

These examples illustrate two different approaches to generating personalized recommendations. The traditional method uses collaborative filtering, while the generative AI method leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate more dynamic and context-aware recommendations.
