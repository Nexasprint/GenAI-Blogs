# üìà Planogram Optimization: Revolutionizing Retail Layouts with AI

**Description:**  
Planogram optimization involves using AI to dynamically update retail store layouts based on new products, changing inventory levels, sales trends, and competitor data. It ensures that product placements maximize sales and enhance the shopping experience.

## üìò Introduction

In the retail industry, the strategic placement of products can significantly influence sales and customer satisfaction. Traditional methods of planogram optimization rely on static layouts and periodic updates, which often fail to keep pace with the rapidly changing retail environment. Enter AI-powered planogram optimization‚Ää-‚Ääa transformative approach that leverages artificial intelligence to create dynamic, data-driven store layouts. By continuously analyzing sales trends, inventory levels, and competitor activities, AI ensures that product placements are always optimized to maximize sales and enhance the shopping experience.

## üöÄ Implementation

AI-driven planogram optimization involves several key steps to ensure that store layouts are always aligned with current market conditions and customer preferences.

### üîÑ Dynamic Adjustment

AI systems analyze real-time sales data to adjust planograms dynamically. Popular items are moved to prominent positions, while slow-moving items are repositioned to improve their visibility and sales potential.

**Example:** In a grocery store, AI might notice an uptick in the sales of seasonal products like summer beverages. It will then adjust the planogram to place these items at eye level and near the store entrance, maximizing their visibility and accessibility.

### üìä Competitive Analysis

AI monitors competitor activities and market trends, adjusting store layouts to maintain a competitive edge. By leveraging insights from market data, AI helps retailers strategically position products to attract more customers.

**Example:** If a competitor launches a new promotional campaign for a specific product category, AI can adjust the planogram to highlight similar products and offer competitive pricing, ensuring the store remains attractive to customers.

### üì¶ Inventory Management

AI optimizes inventory placement within planograms to minimize out-of-stock situations and reduce holding costs. By analyzing inventory levels and sales velocity, AI ensures that high-demand products are always available and easy to find.

**Example:** AI might detect that a popular snack item is frequently out of stock. It will then adjust the planogram to place this item in a more prominent location and suggest increasing the stock level to meet demand.

### üõí Customer Experience

Optimized planograms enhance store navigation and product visibility, improving the overall customer experience. By making it easier for customers to find what they need, AI-driven layouts increase satisfaction and drive higher sales conversion rates.

**Example:** AI can organize products in a way that aligns with common shopping patterns, such as placing related items near each other (e.g., chips and dip), making it easier for customers to find complementary products and encouraging additional purchases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code for Traditional Method of Planogram Optimization using Numpy

```python
import numpy as np

# Example data: sales, inventory, and product positions
sales_data = np.array([100, 50, 75, 30, 90])
inventory_data = np.array([10, 20, 15, 40, 5])
product_positions = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Function to adjust planogram based on sales data
def adjust_planogram(sales, positions):
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(sales)[::-1]
    return positions[sorted_indices]

# Adjust planogram
new_positions = adjust_planogram(sales_data, product_positions)
print("New Planogram Positions:", new_positions)
```
## ü§© Simplified Code Generation Using AI-Horizon's SDK and GenAI

Steps to Get Started with Our SDK
Installation:
```python

# Unfortunately, our SDK is not publicly available and cannot be installed for free.
# Please contact us at neelesh[@]ai-horizon.io for more information on acquiring access to our SDK.
```

Configuration:
```python
import openai
import our_api
our_api.api_key = 'our_api_key'
```
Usage:
```python
import requests

# AI Horizon API endpoint and API key (replace with your actual API endpoint and key)
api_endpoint = 'your_api_endpoint'
api_key = 'your_api_key'

# Function to generate optimized planogram using AI Horizon's Generative AI
def generate_planogram(sales_data, inventory_data):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    payload = {'sales_data': sales_data.tolist(), 'inventory_data': inventory_data.tolist()}
    try:
        response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()['optimized_planogram']
        else:
            print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
sales_data = [100, 50, 75, 30, 90]
inventory_data = [10, 20, 15, 40, 5]
optimized_planogram = generate_planogram(sales_data, inventory_data)
print("Optimized Planogram Positions:", optimized_planogram)
```
